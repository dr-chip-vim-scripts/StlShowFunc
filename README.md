_Showing Functions in the Status Line_

Here is the community edtion of Dr Chip's StlShowFunc Vim plugin:  
http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#STLSHOWFUNC

It's created to accumulate collaboration efforts around the plugin,
since it's author, Dr Chip - is not always responsive.

Installation
------------
Use whatever Vim plugin manager you want. E.g., for [minpac](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac), add this to your _vimrc_:
```vim

```
